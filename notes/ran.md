## Radio Access Network
This is part of a mobile network, that is it will most often be part of a Telco
providers network. These used to be specific hardware but now there they can
now be virtuallized and run on standard servers, and this is called vRAN. These
are often container-based and cloud-native. This gives them all the scalability
and management that enterprise clouds. I think this gives them the ability to
increase/scale up in geograpical areas that have increased usage.

Open RAN (ORAN) is an effort to standardize RAN interfaces so that there is
interoperatility between RAN vendors.
